## Stages of task execution

1. **Select Car Type**: The user must select the car type from the suggested categories such as sedan, hatchback, coupe, minivan, SUV.

2. **Selecting a car model**: After selecting the type of car, the user selects a specific model from those available in that category, each of which has its own price.

3. **Color selection**: The user selects the color of the car from the suggested options (black, white, gray). Available colors are limited, and the user can select only one of the suggested ones.

4. **Confirmation of selection**: After selecting the model and color, the user is shown information about the selected car, including type, model, color and price.

5. **Payment and completion of purchase**: The user confirms the purchase, after which the system displays the final price and completes the purchase process.

To complete the task, you will need to use:
- **Loops** to process user input and iterate through the list of available cars.
- **Conditional statements** to check the user's selection and display the available options.
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** to create classes, encapsulate data, and control the behavior of objects.
- **Basic elements of Python**, such as working with data, functions, input, and output.
